bookmarklet-boilerplate
=======================

This should make people's lives a little bit easier. Follow these simple steps:

1. Edit `js/bookmarklet.js` so that it does something cool in `addBookmarklet()` and cleans up after itself in `removeBookmarklet()`.
1. Edit `test.html` so that it contains stuff your bookmarklet cares about.
1. Open up `test.html` in a web browser and make sure it works.
1. Re-build the minified version with `make clean all`.
1. Open up `index.html` in a web browser, and drag the big bookmarklet link into your browser's bookmarks bar.
1. Visit another page on the web, then click on your link in the bookmarks bar.
